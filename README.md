# Next.js Blank Page Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Next.js applications where the page renders blank despite seemingly correct code.  The issue arises from a subtle error in the component's rendering logic.

## Bug Description
The `pages/index.js` file contains a simple component that should render "Hello world".  However, the application displays a blank page in the browser.

## Solution
The solution involves checking for common errors like typos in the component's structure or unexpected issues with data fetching (though not relevant in this simple example).

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the blank page in your browser.

## Solution Explanation
This example is designed to highlight a common error where developers might overlook trivial issues. The solution is to verify each element of the rendering process.
